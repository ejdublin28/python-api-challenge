While the maximum temperature in the Northern Hemisphere has a strong correlation to the latitude, this relationship is weaker in the Southern Hemisphere. This could be the result of looking at maximum temperatures rather than the average or median temperatures or could have been impacted based on the cities that were randomly selected. 

In the Southern Hemisphere, there appears to be a weak linear relationship between humidity and latitude. However, the scatterplot shows that closer to the equator means greater humidity. The variance of the data seems to increase as you move further away from the equator. 

Cloudiness in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres seems to occur on the extremes, as many data cities have either 0% or 100% cloudiness.
